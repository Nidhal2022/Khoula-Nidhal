st.write('''1)This is quite interesting the number of rooms does have a great impact in the rent. More rooms, the rent increases...

2)Sao Paulo are mostly accepting pets and mostly all the other cities are also accepting the pets

3)Mostly the house which allows pets are more costly compared to house that doesn't allows pet and there is some relationship between animal acceptance and total rent

4)Non-Furnished homes are more costly and they are highly opted!!!
Sao Paulo is the city with more non-furnitured houses ''')
